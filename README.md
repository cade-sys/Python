Python Projects

These Python scripts are just a few of my projects that I've done in Python.

The script approxFibonacci takes an integer provided by the user and uses it to approximate the golden ratio using the Fibonacci series.

approxPi also takes user input in the form of an integer and uses the Abraham Seires to approximate Pi with the given integer.

The lifeformSimulation project is the most interesting. It simulates the galaxy as a cylinder and even excludes the uninhabitable galactic core. Then, planets which contain extraterrestrial life are generated and placed using Monte Carlo techniques. Then Earth is generated and given a detection radius of 1000 lightyears to detect if any planets with life are nearby. The simulation is ran 15000 times and returns how many lifeforms were found.
