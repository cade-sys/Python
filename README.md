Python Projects

These Python scripts are just a few of my projects that I've done in Python.

The script approxFibonacci takes an integer provided by the user and uses it to approximate the golden ratio using the Fibonacci series.

approxPi also takes user input in the form of an integer and uses the Abraham Seires to approximate Pi with the given integer.
